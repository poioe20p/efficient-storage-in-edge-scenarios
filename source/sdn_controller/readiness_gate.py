"""readiness_gate.py — RQ3 compute-backend readiness gate.

Gates ``VIP_SERVER`` pool admission on a verified application-readiness event
(``/ready``), under two switchable propagation modes:

  - ``direct``:    RQ3 v2 (approach A, event-driven): admit on the edge's
                   ``app_ready`` control event (no probe before admission);
                   /ready is used only for the post-admission identity check,
                   the event-absence safety net (``READINESS_EVENT_FALLBACK_S``),
                   and abandonment detection.
  - ``discovery``: probe only on the ``DISCOVERY_POLL_INTERVAL_S`` cadence;
                   admit when a discovery pass observes 200 (periodic
                   discovery).

The gate is active only when ``READINESS_PROPAGATION != "off"`` (constructed
in ``main_n*.py``). When off, no gate exists and Thread 3 registers backends
immediately (pre-RQ3 behavior, byte-identical).

Owns a native worker daemon thread (blocking HTTP probes). See
``docs/research_questions/v2/rq3/rq3_preparation.md``.
