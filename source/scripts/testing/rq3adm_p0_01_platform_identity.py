"""RQ3 admission-modes P0 — platform-identity gate (plan §6, §12.1).

Captures, on the campaign host (`cloud-vm-rq3`), the deployed platform
identity and admission-path surface, then compares them against the recorded
reference exactly per plan §6:

- the per-group EXECUTION trees — the trees each group's runs launch from:
  timing group `--timing-tree` (default `~/rq3tim_frozen` @ `852a8a3`, tag
  `rq3tim-preflight-20260908`), soundness group `--soundness-tree` (default
  `~/rq3snd_frozen2` @ `541fb22`, tag `rq3snd-preflight-20261003`), and the
  supporting/C3 group `--support-tree` (default this campaign tree — the C3
  launcher derives its REPO_ROOT from its own location; validated against the
  C3 record: the v2 env files `rq3_direct.env` / `rq3_discovery.env` /
  `rq3_discovery_15.env` and the per-set archived profile hashes the launcher
  asserts; the declared drop knob is not part of this group's surface) — and
  `edge_server:latest` image IDs (recorded `207b1f9e8f64` for the soundness
  era);
- the operator tree (`--deployed-root`, default this repo): reported
  informationally only — it is not an execution surface (2026-10-11 (e)) and
  never causes DRIFT in the verdict;
- the admission-path surface: `readiness_gate.py`, the
  `compute_node_manager.py` admission functions, `edge_server/source/app.py`
  readiness/bind ordering, `control_events.py`, the arm/fault env files and
  the `phases.json` profile — each group's execution tree against its own
  recorded manifest, with the operator tree compared informationally;
- the declared default-off knob rule (app.py: `EDGE_READY_PREMATURE_S`,
  `EDGE_READY_SEMANTIC_LIE_S`; readiness_gate.py:
  `READINESS_WAKE_VERIFY_MODE`): the hash may be taken over the off-path
  surface (declared knob lines excluded), or the recorded off-path
  byte-identity proof (soundness manifest hash + the recorded
  `make_server`-bind-before-emission ordering facts) substitutes on that file;
  a difference outside a declared knob block, or an unverifiable knob-off
  claim, fails the comparison.

Verdict (every required comparison item must be defined on both sides and
equal; a required item missing from the record is UNDEFINED and blocks):
Verdict, stage-scoped (2026-10-11 (g)): the report carries `c1_c2_gate`
(timing + soundness groups: the matrix) and `c3_gate` (supporting/campaign
group: the five supporting runs); the overall `verdict` is their conjunction.
A `c3_gate` block stops only the supporting batch (C3) and never the matrix;
a `c1_c2_gate` block stops C1/C2. Every required comparison item must be
defined on both sides and equal; a required item missing from the record is
UNDEFINED and blocks its own stage.
  MATCH -> proceed; DRIFT or blocking UNDEFINED -> do not extend; the §6.4
corrective full re-run matrix applies on a c1_c2 stage DRIFT. The timing-image
item is the one recorded waiver: with no timing-era ID in the record it is
reported WAIVED (non-blocking, provenance-carrying; plan §6) — its search is
scoped to the timing execution tree, and operator-tree candidates are
informational only. Items with no recorded reference are reported as
NOT_RECORDED and the verdict output prints a summary line counting them
(`NOT_RECORDED (informational): N items`), so a reader can see what was not
checked; all other required items keep the UNDEFINED-blocks rule.

Exit codes (plan §12.1): 0 = MATCH; 3 = DRIFT, blocking UNDEFINED, or a
capture/compare error (STOP — never a silent pass); argparse usage errors exit
2. Output: `analysis/platform_identity.json` under the plan folder (plus the
raw capture alongside it).

Usage:
  python3 rq3adm_p0_01_platform_identity.py                 # capture + compare
  python3 rq3adm_p0_01_platform_identity.py --no-docker     # offline capture
  python3 rq3adm_p0_01_platform_identity.py --compare-only capture.json
  python3 rq3adm_p0_01_platform_identity.py --selftest      # fixture checks
