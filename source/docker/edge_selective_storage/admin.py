    Returns ``202 Accepted`` immediately; the real work runs in a background

    factor. Ordering inside the worker thread (critical for the clean-shutdown
    guarantee — every collection's resume-token file must reflect the last
    applied change):

      1. Under ``_workers_lock``, call ``worker.stop()`` on every
         :class:`ForwarderWorker`. Each worker closes its Change Stream,
         applies any in-flight event, and persists its final resume token.
      2. Emit a ``drain_complete`` control event over the telemetry PUSH
         socket. The SDN controller's
         :class:`ControlEventDispatcher.process_drain_events` sees this and
         submits the Phase B :class:`CleanupSelectiveAlert`.
      3. Run ``db.adminCommand({shutdown: 1})`` against ``localhost``.
         ``mongod`` exits; the entrypoint's ``wait $MONGOD_PID`` returns
         and the container terminates.
